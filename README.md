Here are some project highlights: 

"CarInsuranceMVC" (Located in separate repo https://github.com/dcmswim/CarInsuranceMVC):
ASP.NET Core app that utilizes MVC to arrange layout of the web app. Includes basic CRUD functionality for users to add new records and receive a car insurance quote based on the inputs provided. Logic in controller determines user's quote.

"IncomeComparison Program": 
Basic console app that accepts user inputs for hourly rate of pay and compares with another user input to determine which salary is higher.

"Shipping":
Basic Console app that accepts user input to calculate shipping cost of a package based on size dimensions and weight. Checks dimensions and weight totals and if they exceed a certain amount will prompt the user that the package is too big/heavy to ship. 

"TwentyOne":
Console App that allows user to play a game of blackjack (21) against a dealer. Logic is included to calculate card values, compare user score against dealer, and calculate winnings based on betting. Subtracts from winnings if dealer wins. Logic included to calculate "best score" if user has an ace card since ace cards are unique and can have multiple values in the game. Some exception handling included such as if user inputs a negative value for their bet. Logic in place for multiple players to participate but current implementation only allows for one person to play at a time against a dealer.
